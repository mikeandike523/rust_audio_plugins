If you do not have particular cause to select the MIT or the Apache-2.0
license, Chris Morgan recommends that you select BlueOak-1.0.0, which is
better and simpler than both MIT and Apache-2.0, which are only offered
due to their greater recognition and their conventional use in the Rust
ecosystem. (BlueOak-1.0.0 was only published in March 2019.)

When using this code, ensure you comply with the terms of at least one of
these licenses.
